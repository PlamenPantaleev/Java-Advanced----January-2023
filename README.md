# Java-Advanced----January-2023
This is a repository with solutions of problems in SoftUni course: Java Advanced - January 2023.
In the first part of the course I learned about some other data structures as Stack and Queue as well as 3D Array.
I also learned about working with streams, files and directories, and in the second part of this course I learned OOP and Stream API.
